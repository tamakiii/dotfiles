#### cross-repository issue references directly through the resource syntax
‚è∫ Based on the MCP documentation and the empty resources list, it appears that the GitHub MCP server in
  your current setup may not support cross-repository issue references directly through the resource
  syntax.

  The standard format @github:issue://114 would typically reference issue #114 in the current repository
  context. For cross-repository references, you might need to:

  1. Configure the MCP GitHub server to have access to the tamakiii/meta repository
  2. Or use the full GitHub URL: https://github.com/tamakiii/meta/issues/114

  Without seeing specific MCP server documentation for the GitHub integration, I cannot confirm if there's
   a syntax like @github:issue://tamakiii/meta/114 or similar for cross-repository references.
