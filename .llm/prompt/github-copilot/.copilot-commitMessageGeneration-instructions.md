# Commit Message Generation Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Commit Message Structure

- Use the conventional commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Keep the first line (subject) concise (50 characters or less)
- Add a blank line followed by a more detailed explanation when needed
- Use the imperative, present tense (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds")
- Capitalize the first word of the description
- Don't end the description with a period

## Commit Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, whitespace)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `build`: Changes to build system or dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

## Scope Guidelines

- Use a noun describing the section of the codebase (e.g., auth, user, api)
- Keep scope names consistent across commits
- Use lowercase for scope names
- Omit the scope if the change spans multiple areas

## Description Quality

- Be specific about what changed
- Focus on WHY the change was made, not HOW
- Reference issue numbers when applicable (e.g., "fixes #123")
- Avoid vague messages like "update code" or "fix bug"
- Include relevant context that future developers would need

## Breaking Changes

- Indicate breaking changes with an exclamation mark after the type/scope
- Example: `feat(api)!: change authentication endpoint response format`
- Include a `BREAKING CHANGE: ` footer with additional details when needed

## Footer Conventions

- Reference issues, PRs, or other relevant information in the footer
- Use footers like `Fixes: #1234` or `Reviewed-by: username`
- Separate multiple footers with newlines

## Examples

Good examples:
```
feat(auth): implement JWT authentication
fix(api): prevent SQL injection in user search
docs: update installation instructions
refactor(core): simplify error handling logic
```
