# Test Generation Instructions for GitHub Copilot

## Testing Methodology

- Prioritize unit tests that focus on a single function or component
- Include integration tests for critical system interactions
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Test both happy paths and edge cases/error conditions
- Create descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

## Test Framework Preferences

- Use modern testing frameworks appropriate for the language
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: Jest, Vitest, or Mocha
  - Python: pytest
  - Java: JUnit
  - C#: xUnit or NUnit
  - Go: standard testing package
- Use mocking frameworks when appropriate to isolate units

## Coverage Goals

- Aim for comprehensive test coverage of business logic
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Include tests for error handling paths
- Cover negative test cases (invalid inputs, failure conditions)

## Test Data

- Use descriptive test data that clearly communicates intent
- Avoid using production or real user data in tests
- Define test fixtures or factory functions for complex test objects
- Consider parameterized tests for testing multiple input combinations

## Testing Style

- Keep tests simple and focused on a single behavior
- Avoid complex logic within tests
- Make test failures easy to diagnose
- Add comments explaining complex test scenarios or setups

## Additional Context

- Generate test data setup and teardown code where appropriate
- Include brief documentation explaining the testing approach
- Reference relevant best practices or documentation
- Consider property-based testing for suitable scenarios
