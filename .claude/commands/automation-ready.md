# Automation Tool Ready

An automation tool has started successfully and is waiting for manual action.

Use the ask_human tool to inform the user about: $ARGUMENTS

The user has specified that I should ALWAYS use ask_human when:
- An automation tool has started successfully and is waiting for manual action
- Seeing messages like "Perfect! Now you can run the export automation commands"
- Any automation tool waiting for user input

I will now ask the human about the automation tool status.
