description: Commit staged changes automatically
---

## Context
- `git status`: !`git status`
- Staged diffs: !`git diff --staged`

## Task
1. Review the staged changes and craft an appropriate commit message
2. Validate that the message is descriptive and not a placeholder
3. Commit automatically with the format:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[CRAFTED_MESSAGE]

```

## Guidelines
- Create concise, descriptive commit messages
- Focus on what changed and why
- Never use placeholder text like "<your message>", "placeholder", etc.
- Ensure message accurately reflects the staged changes
