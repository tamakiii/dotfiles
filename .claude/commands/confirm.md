# Confirmation Required

I need to ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.

Use the ask_human tool to get user confirmation for: $ARGUMENTS

The user has specified that I should ALWAYS use ask_human when encountering:
- "Do you want to proceed?" with Yes/No options
- Any bash command confirmation dialog
- Any situation requiring user confirmation before proceeding

I will now ask the human for confirmation.
