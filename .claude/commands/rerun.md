# Ask to Run Again

I need to ask the user if they would like me to run something again.

Use the ask_human tool to ask: "Would you like me to run $ARGUMENTS again?"

The user has specifically requested that I ALWAYS use ask_human for "Would you like me to run it again?" or similar re-run questions instead of proceeding automatically.

I will now ask the human if they want me to run this again.
